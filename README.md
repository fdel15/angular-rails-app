This is my first rails-angular application.

The app is a hacker-news type site that allows a user to login, create a post, add comments, and upvote posts and comments.

I followed [this tutorial] (https://thinkster.io/angular-rails/) to create this app.

Prior to this app I had zero experience with Angularjs. The purpose of this
application was to learn how to configure a Rails application with
Angular using the asset pipeline. It was a great learning experience
and I now understand why Angular is such a popular front end framework.

Technologies used:
-Angularjs
-Rails
-Bootstrap
